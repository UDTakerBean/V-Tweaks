## 4.0.0

This rewrite includes a couple of major changes:

## Removed Features:

- All Enchantments: Chopdown somewhat removes the need for Lumbering and I always hated the Imperishable implementation
- Bonemeal Tweaks: Bonemealing non-bonemealable blocks
- Drop Tweaks: Configurable despawn timers, egg hatching, sapling planting - these were all bad.
- Pet Armory: Throw gear at tamed pets - this was poorly implemented and was never worth the time to learn rendering
- Death Point: This really isn't necessary now with the new echo compass thing in 1.19
- Low Health Sound: Not really fitting for this mod, and its implementation was very data-modification heavy
- Chat message welcoming you to V-Tweaks is removed, this was annoying. I'll be implementing an optional Patchouli book for this soon :)

## Added Features

- Corpse Drops Tweak - Items dropped by the player upon death will no longer despawn like other items.
- Cactus Item Protection - prevents items from being eaten up by Cacti. **Configuration change requires restart**

## Overhauls

- Fluid Conversion Recipes - this _used_ to be the Concrete Tweak, but now they're Datapack based and you can modify the defaults (currently they just include all concrete powder -> concrete conversions)! You can specify the fluid, input and output and the recipe will automatically propagate in JEI with the custom plugin I made.
- Falling blocks caused by the Chop Down tweak will no longer drop leaves, but instead drop the block's corresponding drops
- `[CODE]` The Tweak system has been introduced. Create a new tweak by extending `VTweak` and using the `@Tweak` annotation. The config system will automatically grab onto what configs you need based on this annotation, and the Tweak Registry will automatically grab and fire all custom tweaks' events
- `[CODE]` Config System has been overhauled, allowing each tweak to house its own configs rather than making them static members of some conglomerate config class. The `category` param in the `@Tweak` annotation tells the config system what category to put the tweak's configs in - if it's not one of the ones listed in `CommonConfig.java` or `ClientConfig.java`, then it will be skipped.

## 3.6.8

- Chopdown will no longer consider player-placed leaves as part of a tree
- Hopefully fixed failure to start due to FastUtils `it.unimi.dsi.fastutil.objects.Object2ObjectOpenHashMap.rehash` error

## 3.6.7

- At long last, the chopdown feature is _no longer experimental_ and has been finished to a point where I am content with it. This update fixes the offsets when breaking trees, as well as rotates logs as they fall.

## 3.6.6.2

- Fixes to NBT breakages!!

## 3.6.6

- Added new optional Anvil Recipe attributes `cpFromLeft` and `cpFromRight`. Assumes to be `false` if not included. `cpFrom[Left|Right]` will copy all NBT **except** for those defined in the output, to the output. You can choose to set BOTH to true, but any overlap in NBT will be overwritten by the **RIGHT** input.

## Should work on 1.19.1 and .2, but this has not been tested.

## 3.6.5.1

- Hopefully resolved issues with `Accessing LegacyRandomSource from multiple threads` errors.

## 3.6.5

### Added

- New `vtweaks:anvil` recipe type -- see below!

### Changed

- Huge internal refactor of code
- Lumbering and Imperishable will not disappear when disabled, but will not function
- Recipes for Enchanted Books now use `vtweaks:anvil` recipes to control inputs and cost

### `vtweaks:anvil`

Inputs AND outputs can have NBT defined for them! This recipe type performs a **_soft_** NBT comparison.
Example: if your item is defined as `{"item": "minecraft:stick", "nbt": { "Damage": 0 }}`, then if you input a stick
with enchantments or other NBT it will **succeed** so long as the NBT matches at the bare minimum the NBT defined in the
recipe (in this case, `{Damage:0}`).
