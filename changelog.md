# V-Tweaks Changelog MC 1.19.x

## 3.6.8

- Chopdown will no longer consider player-placed leaves as part of a tree
- Hopefully fixed failure to start due to FastUtils `it.unimi.dsi.fastutil.objects.Object2ObjectOpenHashMap.rehash` error

## 3.6.7

- At long last, the chopdown feature is *no longer experimental* and has been finished to a point where I am content with it. This update fixes the offsets when breaking trees, as well as rotates logs as they fall.

## 3.6.6.2

- Fixes to NBT breakages!! 

## 3.6.6

- Added new optional Anvil Recipe attributes `cpFromLeft` and `cpFromRight`. Assumes to be `false` if not included. `cpFrom[Left|Right]` will copy all NBT **except** for those defined in the output, to the output. You can choose to set BOTH to true, but any overlap in NBT will be overwritten by the **RIGHT** input. 

## Should work on 1.19.1 and .2, but this has not been tested.

## 3.6.5.1

- Hopefully resolved issues with `Accessing LegacyRandomSource from multiple threads` errors.

## 3.6.5

### Added

- New `vtweaks:anvil` recipe type -- see below!

### Changed

- Huge internal refactor of code
- Lumbering and Imperishable will not disappear when disabled, but will not function
- Recipes for Enchanted Books now use `vtweaks:anvil` recipes to control inputs and cost

### `vtweaks:anvil`

Inputs AND outputs can have NBT defined for them! This recipe type performs a **_soft_** NBT comparison.
Example: if your item is defined as `{"item": "minecraft:stick", "nbt": { "Damage": 0 }}`, then if you input a stick
with enchantments or other NBT it will **succeed** so long as the NBT matches at the bare minimum the NBT defined in the
recipe (in this case, `{Damage:0}`).
